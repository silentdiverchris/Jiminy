# Jiminy
A custom TODO system that scans through .md files in a set of nominated directories, finds 
custom tags (an extended GTD-type set), combines and structures them and generates a 
static 'What should I be doing now?' html file, then picks up on changes to/new .md files 
and refreshes the static output.

# Jiminy
A custom TODO system that scans through .md files in a set of nominated directories, finds custom tags (an extended GTD-type set), combines and structures them and generates a static 'What should I be doing now?' html file, then picks up on changes to/new .md files and refreshes the static output.

The idea is to finally come up with something that suits me better than Evernote, OneNote, BoostNote and the rest of the systems I've tried over the years.

My solution is to go back to good old files in directories, but now with MarkDown as the glue that holds everything together and this program to dig my tags out of all the .md files and provide some overall structure, prioritisation, reminders and the like.

I'll put some actual documentation together when it matures a bit more.
